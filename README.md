# Api test using Postman:Restful-Booker.
This repository contains a Postman collection and environment setup for testing the Restful Booker API. The API provides basic functionality for managing hotel bookings.
ðŸ”§ Here's what I worked on:
* Designed and organized test collections in Postman.
* Used Collection Runner for executing automated tests.
* Wrote JavaScript-based test scripts to validate:
  
    1.HTTP status codes
    2. JSON responses
    3.Auth token handling
    4.CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   

<h3>Contents:</h3>
                                   
        RestfulBooker.postman_collection.json: A Postman collection with pre-configured requests for all major API endpoints.
